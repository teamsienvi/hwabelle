                HWABELLE is committed to protecting customer information and the information of our marketplace and API partners. We limit the collection, use, retention, and sharing of personal data to what is strictly necessary for business operations, order fulfillment, customer service, fraud prevention, and legal compliance. This policy applies to all information processed through our website, ecommerce systems, third-party integrations (including Amazon Selling Partner API), fulfillment workflows, and support operations.

                <p>
                  This Data Protection Policy describes the technical, administrative, and organizational safeguards we maintain to protect personally identifiable information ("PII") and confidential data—including information received through marketplace partner APIs such as the Amazon Selling Partner API ("Amazon Information"). All personnel, contractors, and authorized systems that process, store, or transmit such data are bound by the requirements of this policy.
                </p>

              <section>
                <h2 className="font-serif text-xl text-foreground mb-3">2. Data Minimization</h2>
                <p>We collect and process only the personal information reasonably necessary to:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-3 space-y-2">
                  <li>Accept and process customer orders</li>

                <p className="mt-3">
                  We do not collect, store, or process personal data beyond what is required for the purposes listed above. Information received from marketplace partners (such as Amazon) is used solely for the specific, approved purposes described in our integration agreements and is never repurposed for unrelated activities such as marketing, profiling, or resale.

                <p>Access to customer data, API credentials, and marketplace information is restricted to authorized personnel who require access for legitimate, defined business purposes.</p>
                <p className="mt-3">We enforce the following access management principles:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-3 space-y-2">
                  <li>Unique, non-shared user accounts for all personnel</li>

                  <li>Role-based access control (RBAC) for all systems that store or process PII</li>
                  <li>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) on systems that store confidential data, API secrets, or PII</li>
                  <li>Prompt revocation of access upon role change or departure</li>
                  <li>Periodic review of privileged accounts and access rights (at minimum quarterly)</li>
                  <li>Segregation of duties for critical operations such as credential management and deployment</li>

              <section>
                <h2 className="font-serif text-xl text-foreground mb-3">4. Authentication and Account Protection</h2>
                <p>We use robust account protection measures including:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-3 space-y-2">
                  <li>Strong password requirements (minimum length, complexity, expiration policies)</li>
                  <li>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative and infrastructure accounts</li>
                  <li>Restricted administrative access with audit logging</li>
                  <li>Encrypted credential storage (API keys, secrets, and tokens are stored exclusively in encrypted environment variables and secret management systems — never in source code, client-side code, or public repositories)</li>
                  <li>Monitoring and alerting for suspicious login activity, brute-force attempts, and anomalous access patterns</li>
                  <li>Automatic session timeout for inactive sessions</li>

                <h2 className="font-serif text-xl text-foreground mb-3">5. Encryption Standards</h2>
                <p>We employ industry-standard encryption to protect customer information and partner data:</p>

                <p>For order fulfillment, we may share shipping-related personal information with approved fulfillment partners. This may include:</p>

              <section>
                <h2 className="font-serif text-xl text-foreground mb-3">8. Data Retention and Secure Disposal</h2>
                <p>We retain customer and partner data only for as long as necessary for:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-3 space-y-2">

                <h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mt-4 mb-2">Retention Periods</h3>
                <p>
                  Transactional and order data is retained for a maximum of 30 days after order completion, unless a longer period is required for legal, tax, or dispute-resolution obligations. Shipping-related PII is deleted or anonymized within 30 days of delivery confirmation unless subject to a legal hold.
                </p>

                <h2 className="font-serif text-xl text-foreground mb-3">11. Incident Response Plan</h2>
                <p>
                  HWABELLE maintains a formal incident response plan to address security incidents involving unauthorized access, misuse, loss, theft, or disclosure of personal or confidential information—including information received from marketplace partners such as Amazon ("Amazon Information").
                </p>

                <h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mt-4 mb-2">Incident Response Procedures</h3>
                <p>Upon detection or reasonable suspicion of a security incident, we will:</p>
                <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 mt-3 space-y-3">
                  <li>
                    <strong>Identify and Contain:</strong> Immediately identify the scope and nature of the incident, isolate affected systems, and take steps to contain the breach and prevent further unauthorized access.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Investigate and Assess:</strong> Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the root cause, the scope of data affected, and the potential impact on affected individuals and partners.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Remediate:</strong> Implement corrective actions to resolve the vulnerability or weakness that led to the incident and prevent recurrence. This may include revoking compromised credentials, patching systems, and updating access controls.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Notify Amazon (24-Hour Requirement):</strong> For any security incident involving Amazon Information — including any suspected or confirmed unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or loss of data received through the Amazon Selling Partner API — we will notify Amazon by emailing <strong>security@amazon.com within 24 hours</strong> of detection. The notification will include a description of the incident, the data involved, the actions taken to contain and remediate the issue, and a point of contact for further communication.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Notify Affected Individuals:</strong> Where required by applicable law or regulation, we will promptly notify affected individuals as prescribed by the relevant jurisdiction's breach notification requirements.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Document and Report:</strong> Maintain a complete written record of the incident, the investigation, the timeline, all actions taken, and all notifications issued. This documentation is retained for post-incident review and regulatory compliance.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Post-Incident Review:</strong> Conduct a post-incident review to evaluate the effectiveness of the response, identify lessons learned, and update this incident response plan, security controls, and training as needed.
                  </li>
                </ol>

                <h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mt-4 mb-2">Cooperation with Partners</h3>
                <p>
                  In the event of a security incident affecting data received from Amazon or other marketplace partners, we will cooperate fully with the partner's security team, provide timely updates on the investigation and remediation, and follow any additional notification or remediation requirements specified in the applicable partner agreement or data protection policy.
